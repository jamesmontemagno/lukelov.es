I wanted to get one "Cofeeshop Without Walls" badge for this year's challenge. I planned out this route pretty well, including a canal that I was pretty familiar with and connecting that with some singletrack that I've run but never biked before. I left it up to how I felt at the time to decide where to make the coffee and whether to do an out-n-back or make a loop and return home via roads.

## The Ride

It was a beautiful morning for the canal, probably even "crisp" by Phoenix standards.

This canal is also part of the Maricopa trail.

It gets pretty close to Red Mountain, almost as close as you can get I think.

I also found this chair sitting alongside the canal near Power Road. I was not brave enough to sit in it.

I eventually made it to Wild Horse Trail which I've run a few times but never ridden. It was a blast. Basically my first real time on singletrack on this bike and it felt great. I'm running tubes with Flat Attack so I kept the pressure pretty high, so I think it would've been even more comfortable if I went tubeless.

After the 3.5 mile stretch, I ended up about halfway up Usery Pass from the river. I made it to the rest of the way and was rewarded with a nice downhill and a stop at the Phoenix sign.

## The Drink

I thought about stopping somewhere along the trail to make coffee but it was kinda crowded, and I was in a rhythm so I didn't want to stop until I was on the downhill. I thought about pulling into Usery Regional Park but I realized I only brought my ID and credit card and left my wallet, meaning I didn't have my yearly pass to get in.

But I made it down the other side of Usery and to Red Mountain park, which had a ton of space and some open ramadas. I made coffee, ate some peanut butter packets, and chilled in a chair.

## One Good Thing

Singletrack! I rode up to Hawes one other time and hopped on the trails and immediately noticed I had a goat head puncture flat. I didn't get out again for awhile, so it was great to try it again. I'm pretty much brand new to off-road cycling so it was a cool confidence builder that I can tackle the easy stuff.

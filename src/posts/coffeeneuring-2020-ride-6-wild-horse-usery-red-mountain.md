I wanted to get one "Cofeeshop Without Walls" badge for this year's challenge. I planned out this route pretty well, including a canal that I was pretty familiar with and connecting that with some singletrack that I've run but never biked before. I left it up to how I felt at the time to decide where to make the coffee and whether to do an out-n-back or make a loop and return home via roads.

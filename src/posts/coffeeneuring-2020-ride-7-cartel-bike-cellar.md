Down to the last day of the challenge, I just needed to ride my bike somewhere to get coffee that I hadn't already been to. I also needed a new stem for my bike. Good thing Cartel Coffee is right by my favorite bike shop The Bicycle Cellar in Tempe!

## The Ride

I took University all the way down to grab coffee and make my Bicycle Cellar appointment on time. On the way bike I went through Papago and hit some climbs that I had to push up! I also came across a part of Papago I didn't know existed which some small dirt jumps. There's no way I was touching any of those so I slowly walked my bike down and rode over to the nice flat canal.

## The Drink

An 80 degree day in November meant it was still iced coffee weather. I went with a small Iced Americano (since it was already the afternoon) and chugged it. It was just too good to savor it.

## One Good Thing

New bike stem!

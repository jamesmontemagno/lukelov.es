There's so much good coffee and food that I never get to downtown. There's even a nice 20 mile route through a pretty easy series of bike routes and canals to get there. So coffeeneuring was a great excuse to get out and try some new places. I figured I would probably only get downtown once so I wanted to hit a few places even though it would only count towards one coffeeneuring challenge trip.

My kids love animals, so when I saw some interesting looking birds I thought it would be fun to take pictures and try to identify them when I got home. We looked them up and [a super cool](http://www.birderfrommaricopa.com) website about birds in Maricopa County.
